# Yomitan compatible Remembering the Kanji dictionary

This repo contains a Yomitan compatible Kanji dictionary for the book,
"Remembering the Kanji" by James W. Heisig (6th Edition).

## How to install it into Yomitan

In Yomitan's settings, go to "Dictionaries", then "Configure installed and
enabled dictionaries".  Then click "Import" and paste the URL:

`https://github.com/cartolad/rtk-kanji-bank/releases/latest/download/rtk.zip`

After the dictionary is imported, order is important.  If you have other Kanji
dictionaries installed, the order of the entries in your popup window is
determined bby the dictionary order.  You probably want to have RTK ahead of
other Kanji dictionaries such as KANJIDIC.
